# Snake Game AI using Q-Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a self-learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent designed to play the Snake Game. By leveraging the Q-learning algorithm, the agent learns optimal strategies for maximizing the game score by consuming food and avoiding obstacles. The aim is to analyze the effectiveness of RL in solving dynamic and complex problems such as Snake.

## Introduction

The Snake Game has a rich history in computer gaming and is now an excellent testbed for applying RL algorithms. This project builds a Q-learning-based agent to autonomously play the game, aiming to improve over time by learning strategies that help the snake grow longer without colliding with walls or itself. 

Key Concepts:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: An area of machine learning where agents learn optimal actions through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on outcomes.
- **Q-Learning**: A value-based RL algorithm used here to enable the agent to make decisions and adapt its strategy over time.
